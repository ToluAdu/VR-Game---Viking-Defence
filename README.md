# VR-Game---Viking-Defence
Developed an immersive multi-level Virtual Reality first person shooter with the Oculus SDK, utilising user viewport head-tracking and the locomotion capabilities of the Oculus Rift and its controllers. Implemented an object interaction system where the user was able to pick, drop, attack and defend with a variety of weapons virtually and interact with a health boost item. Created an enemy AI targeting script using the NavMeshAgent class where enemyâ€™s were able to scale a layered terrain and track the user, and when in range attack the using conditional chase or attack states.
